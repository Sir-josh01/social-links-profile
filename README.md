## My process

-Built the HTML structure and completed it with the CSS. The alignment was smooth and easy, with each button having a hover effect and focus effect.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
@media (max-width: 490px) {
  .wrapper {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

-It remains the alignment of element with different devices.

### Useful resources
